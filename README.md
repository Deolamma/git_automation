# GIT AUTOMATION
### This is a simple repository that helps automate the git add, commit and push processes

Note:
- The push command in this pushes to the remote repository. I was going to implement pushing to branches or an upstream branch, but I thought this was supposed to make process faster and not longer. I left out that feature, but feel free to fork andupdate as you wish
